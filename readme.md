# ALL ABOUT CANVAS and CANVAS GAMES - âœ”

This "All about CANVAS and CANVAS GAMES"-repository catches up its focus on all the projects I was working on while using on a canvas system through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.
        
Direct Link to the place where I'm studying are you going to find [HERE](https://www.sae.edu/che/de?utm_source=PS01&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLVIaD_aUt7y4brT7tqMW9o7tskgb1vjQqJFkzQwkwdN_40_Ls7MgAEaAtXxEALw_wcB)

``AJAX`` = Asynchronous* Javascript and XML 

_**Means:**_

* Asynchronous Request (Fetch = Vanilla, JQuery Ajax = JQuery, etc) and Responses.
XML = Obsolete, actually works like HTML. Through Json (text version of JS)

| $ nodemon (...)  | Using NODEMON to start the serverside workingspace |
| $ npm install -g nodemon  | Install Nodemon (This is the version to Install it once globally) |
