# ALL ABOUT CANVAS and CANVAS GAMES - âœ”

<img align="center" alt="Canvas Picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YpEmDFi.jpg" /> <br>

This "All about CANVAS and CANVAS GAMES"-repository catches up its focus on all the projects I was working on while using on a canvas system through the years as a **SAE-Web Development** student with exercise lessons every week as well as tutorial videos on _Youtube_.
Direct Link to the place where I'm studying are you going to find [HERE](https://www.sae.edu/che/de?utm_source=PS01&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLVIaD_aUt7y4brT7tqMW9o7tskgb1vjQqJFkzQwkwdN_40_Ls7MgAEaAtXxEALw_wcB)

{ðŸ’¥} => [HERE](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/21-ridiculously-impressive-html5-canvas-experiments--net-14210) are 25 CRAZY CANVAS EXPERIMENTS to demonstrate of what canvas can actually do (also for your next project)

## &nbsp;CANVAS - Useful Assistance âœ…
***

_**CANVAS:**_

* is a "Leinwand" on which you can draw / display objects and surfaces. [Here](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/21-ridiculously-impressive-html5-canvas-experiments--net-14210) are some additional examples.
- is pixel-based, unlike the other HTML5 elements, consisting of Width and Height. We have control over every single pixel.
- elements do have 2D-Context: (X- / Y- axis based while "WEBGL" has 3Dimensional points.
- do have attributes like: Alpha True (Transparent background), Fill (fill area), Stroke (outlines): Draw images, texts, paths, etc...
- are integrated in Google Maps where it can be used to reload map material each time you zoom (interactivity).
- image rendering is alyways fixed on the (0/0)-starting point in the upper left corner.
- Fact: ``CANVAS`` := ``WEBGL``


_**ANTI-ALIASING:**_

* Calculates clean transitions, straight lines. Semi-transparency must be calculated everywhere to achieve sharp transitions on a pixel basis.
